    I propose a poster which will present an online Turing Machine simulator (\url{https://naereen.github.io/jsTuring_fr/turing.html}),
    which has been used successfully for a course introducing calculability and complexity to engineering students in France,
    as well as for a master's degree course for students preparing the computer science major option at the ``agr{\'e}gation'' national exam in mathematics.
    The poster detail the user interface of the Turing Machine simulator, and explain these two successful use cases.

\section{Outline of the poster content}

The poster will present the following points.

\paragraph{Presentation of Turing Machine}

I quickly introduce the notations of the Turing Machine model, using modern notations \cite{turingmachine}, and not the historical notations from Turing's paper.
%
A (one-tape) Turing machine can be formally defined as a 7-tuple $M=\langle Q,\Gamma ,b,\Sigma ,\delta ,q_{0},F\rangle$ where

\begin{small}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    $Q$ is a finite, non-empty set of states;
    \item
    $\Gamma$ is a finite, non-empty set of tape alphabet symbols;
    \item
    $b\in \Gamma$ is the blank symbol (the only symbol allowed to occur on the tape infinitely often at any step during the computation);
    \item
    $\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma \setminus \{b\}$ is the set of input symbols, that is, the set of symbols allowed to appear in the initial tape contents;
    \item
    $q_{0}\in Q$ is the initial state;
    \item
    $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of final states or accepting states. The initial tape contents is said to be accepted by $M$ if it eventually halts in a state from $F$.
    \item
    $\delta :(Q\setminus F)\times \Gamma \not \to Q\times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}$ is a partial function called the transition function, where L is left shift, R is right shift. If $\delta$ is not defined on the current state and the current tape symbol, then the machine halts.
\end{itemize}
\end{small}


\paragraph{Presentation of the online Turing Machine simulator}

The presented Turing Machine simulator \cite{morphett_simulators,naereen_simulators},
can be found online at
\url{http://morphett.info/turing/} in English,
and \url{https://naereen.github.io/jsTuring_fr/turing.html} in French.
%
By including two screenshots of the user interface, we present the different components of a Turing Machine (tape, state, input word, transition table etc).
We also present the user interface of the simulator, which allows to save a machine described by its transition table $\delta$ to an online file (using GitHub's anonym gists, \url{https://gist.github.com/}), and to load machines already written.

\paragraph{Use cases for teaching}

By allowing to load pre-written examples of Turing Machine, the simulator was successfully used in practical sessions for two different classes since 2017.


\paragraph{A curiosity: universal Turing Machine}

The last part of the poster will detail the interesting case of the universal Turing Machine, to tackle the most curious attendees of the conference.
